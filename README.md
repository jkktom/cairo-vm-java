# Cairo VM in Java

## Why (the problem)
- Starknet needs client diversity (there are only a few)

- Java-based infrastructures, including the Bitcoin ecosystem, are blocked from adopting Starknet capabilities.

- [Why Cairo VM or why Java?](WHY.md)

## What it solves (solution)

- Resolves client dependency (Adds Java to the scene)

- Java applications will be able to embed Cairo VM directly into their tech stack, enabling teams to own the full stack end-to-end, leverage existing tooling and infrastructure, and deploy everything in one unified stack. 
 
- Enables Java based Bitcoin ecosystem companies to adopt Starknet capabilities without architectural compromises.

## How to accomplish

[ ] study Starknet ZK Stark theoretics - FRI and Circle (STONE, STWO)

[ ] study Cairo white paper

[ ] study existing Cairo VM

[ ] study JAVA (Deep)
