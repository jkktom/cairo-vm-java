# Cairo VM in Java

## Why (the problem)

- Java-based companies (including the Bitcoin ecosystem), are blocked from adopting Starknet capabilities.

- Starknet needs client diversity.


## What it solves (solution)

- Resolves client dependency (Rust, Go + Java)

- A native Java Cairo VM allows teams to embed Cairo VM directly in their existing Java applications.

- Java teams can own the full stack end-to-end, leverage existing tooling and infrastructure, and deploy everything in one unified stack. 
 
- This enables Bitcoin ecosystem companies to adopt Starknet capabilities without architectural compromises.

## How to accomplish

[ ] study Starknet ZK Stark theoretics - FRI and Circle (STONE, STWO)

[ ] study Cairo white paper

[ ] study existing Cairo VM

[ ] study JAVA (Deep)
